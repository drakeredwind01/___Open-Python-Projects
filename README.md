# ___Open-Python-Projects
A great way for anyone to jump into a Python group

we have meetings every Saturday from 10am-12pm PST https://discord.gg/8GpWuVvdbQ

we'll start by creating a project (probably starting with beginner) and 
if the project gets too complicated we'll clone the project and reasign it as the next level up, leaving the starting point for others try to get into it.
# sugest a new project
create an issue titled:
"NEW PROJECT: {title}"
then add everything you are thinking about for the project
add the label "new_project" to your issue
